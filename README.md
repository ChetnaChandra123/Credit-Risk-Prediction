# Credit-Risk-Prediction
This project aims to simulate credit risk prediction using the German Credit Dataset. The dataset lacks an explicit 'Risk' column, so a derived classification strategy was implemented based on key financial behavior indicators such as credit history, loan amount, duration, savings, employment status, and other customer attributes.

The application uses various machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Key Features:

Data preprocessing with encoding and scaling

Model training and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

A Streamlit web interface to predict credit risk (Good/Bad) based on user inputs

Personalized output messages with recommendations for improving credit profiles

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can infer credit risk even in the absence of explicit risk labels, by analyzing patterns and behaviors in the data.
